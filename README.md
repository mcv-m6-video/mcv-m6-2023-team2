Welcome to the `README` of the _Video Surveillance for Road Traffic Monitoring_ project within _Module 6: Video Analysis_ of the Master's program in Computer Vision at UAB. This repository contains the code associated with this project.

## Introduction

The project aims to develop a solution for the AI City Challenge, focusing on addressing the problem of City-Scale Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking. Our goal is to create an efficient and accurate system for monitoring road traffic using video surveillance.


## Project Deliverables

The module comprises of five distinct deliveries that progressively contribute to a complete pipeline for road traffic monitoring. Each week's delivery focuses on specific aspects and includes the corresponding code. For further explanations, requirements, and the complete code for each week, please refer to the respective `README.md` file.


## Get Started

To begin exploring this project, access the specific `README.md` file associated with each week. It provides explanations, requirements, and the code to guide you through the implementation and understanding of our approach.
