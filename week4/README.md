# Week 4


## Task 1: Optical flow



## Task 2: Multi-Target Single-Camera tracking



## Task 3: Results for SEQ 1 & SEQ 4



## Setup
You'll need to install the cython package to run the code. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install cython
```

Then, install pyflow by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pathak22/pyflow.git
cd pyflow/
python setup.py build_ext -i
```

*Note: If you are using a Windows machine, you will need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools. You can download them [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017). Also, comment line 9 in pyflow/src/project.h.*


## Execution
 
To execute each task, simply run with:

```bash
python task_X_X.py -h
```
